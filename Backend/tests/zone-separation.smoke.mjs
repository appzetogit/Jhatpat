/**
 * One vertical's zones must never be another's.
 *
 * Run: node tests/zone-separation.smoke.mjs
 *
 * Food and taxi each draw their own delivery zones, in their own panels,
 * against their own maps. They are two separate things that happen to share a
 * shape, and the platform keeps them apart with a distinct mongoose model name
 * and a distinct collection.
 *
 * If that slipped, the failure would be quiet and expensive: a zone drawn in
 * one vertical would appear in the other, a seller's zoneId would resolve
 * against the wrong map, and an order would be refused as "we don't deliver
 * there" for an address the vertical plainly covers. Nothing would throw.
