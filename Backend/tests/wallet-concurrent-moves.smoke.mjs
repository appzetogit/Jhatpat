/**
 * Two things happening to one wallet at the same moment.
 *
 * Run: node tests/wallet-concurrent-moves.smoke.mjs
 *
 * Every wallet move was load, mutate, save: read the balance, unshift a row
 * onto the embedded transactions array, write the document back. Two moves on
 * one wallet then raced.
 *
 * The credit side surfaced first: a return payout that failed about one run in
 * three with Mongoose's own words -- "No matching document found for id
 * ... modifiedPaths transactions, balance". One customer returning two items
 * is two refunds at once: the second threw, and they were paid for one return
 * until somebody retried the other by hand.
 *
 * The debit side is the one that costs money the other way. The balance check
 * was a separate read before the save, so two orders paid from one wallet
 * together both passed it and both wrote, and the customer spent more than
 * they had.
 *
 * Both are now one atomic update, which is what these checks pin.
